shortLabel RBPs on Neat1 w.r.t. HNRNPD: union
longLabel RNA binding proteins on long non-coding RNAs Neat1 with respect to the binding sites of HNRNPD. The red sites are the places where proteins have competitive binding with HNRNPD, whereas green sites are places where cooperative binding occurs. The thresholds used for competitive binding was 0bp to 15bp and 15bp to 56bp for cooperative binding
