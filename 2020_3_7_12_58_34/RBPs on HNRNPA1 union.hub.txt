shortLabel RBPs on HNRNPA1 w.r.t. HNRNPC: union
longLabel RNA binding proteins on long non-coding RNAs HNRNPA1 with respect to the binding sites of HNRNPC. The red sites are the places where proteins have competitive binding with HNRNPC, whereas green sites are places where cooperative binding occurs. The thresholds used for competitive binding was 0bp to 15bp and 15bp to 56bp for cooperative binding
