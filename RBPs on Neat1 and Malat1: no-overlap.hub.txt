shortLabel RBPs on Neat1 and Malat1 w.r.t. AUF1: no-overlap
longLabel RNA binding proteins on long non-coding RNAs Neat1 and Malat1 with respect to the biniding sites of AUF1. The red sites are the places where proteins have competitive binding with AUF1, whereas green sites are places where cooperative binding occurs. The thresholds used for competitive binding was 0bp to 15bp and 15bp to 56bp for cooperative bidning
