shortLabel RBPs on HNRNPD w.r.t. : union
longLabel RNA binding proteins on long non-coding RNAs HNRNPD with respect to the binding sites of . The red sites are the places where proteins have competitive binding with , whereas green sites are places where cooperative binding occurs. The thresholds used for competitive binding was 0bp to 15bp and 15bp to 56bp for cooperative binding
